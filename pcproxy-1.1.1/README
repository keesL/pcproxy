Introduction
============

PCProxy is a program that allows multiple clients to connect to an fsd network,
such as Vatsim or IVAO, while only one real connection is made. This is
particulary useful for having multiple ProController or ASRC sector files
active, or for someone who wants to be a tower controller. In tech-terms, it is
a multi-connect masquerading proxy for fsd traffic over TCP/IP.
